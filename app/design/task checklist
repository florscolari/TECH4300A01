▸ Set strings in strings.xml
▸ Set strings in activity_main.xml
▸ Set id in activity_main.xml
▸ Set a top bar (box) in the background
    📘 Shape: Rectangle vs SVG?
    🐞 top box isn't taking its parent's height -> SOLVED. it was because it has size defined within the drawable. I removed it and it worked.

    📘 dp units
▸ Set drawable for profile picture
▸ Set circle as image container
    📘 How to make an ImageView rounded? -> SOLVED. Used ShapeableImageView instead of ImageView
    Add style for rounded container on Themes
    ⚠️ ShapeableImageView is within the default Android Studio setup. TBD if it is allowed for A1. So cool to use!
    🐞 shapeableImageView doesn't display image when running emulator. SOLVED. The right way of pointing the image resource is android:src=, I was using tools:srcCompat

--- Button Views ---
▸ Set primary and secondary styles on themes to be reusable
    ⚠️ How on earth an outline button is a custom one instead of being a default view?
▸ Set secondary btn as custom btn
    🐞 Having components from Material Components are overwriting the components that don't have that theme applied. I tried to have both types but it didn't work.
       SOLUTION APPLIED: Understand and using button views only from material components (Outlined btn and Contained btn)
▸ Set color by state to add feedback after tapping btn --> No need to set it, it has been handled by Material Components

--- Text Views ---
    📘 Each view needs at least 1 vertical constraint and 1 horizontal constraint
▸ Set styles on themes.xml for heading 1, heading 2, and label
